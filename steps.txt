1) capture 1 frame per second
2) feed it to yolov3_object_detection.py
3) wrap all calls in one python code
4) see if yolov3 can be improved
5) check if we can determine whats to left right up down centre
6) check if distance can be measured
7) text to audio , list things to left right up down centre
8) if something is less than 50% probability say 'most probably but not sure' when listing that object in audio
