# Create an object. Zero for external camera
# To capture a video, you need to create a VideoCapture object.
# Its argument can be either the device index or the name of a video file.
# Device index is just the number to specify which camera.
# Normally one camera will be connected (as in my case). So I simply pass 0 (or -1).
# You can select the second camera by passing 1 and so on.
# After that, you can capture frame-by-frame.
# But at the end, donâ€™t forget to release the capture.
